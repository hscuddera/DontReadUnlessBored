**Progress In Synoptic Major:**

*MAJOR TITLE: EXISTENTIAL RISK AND RATIONALITY STUDIES*  
  
(never fear most objections are strawmen or stupid so dont give up your ground.)  
  
longer version of title is a BA in The study of Exsistential risk through the lens of or in light of rationality or rationality studies.  
  
What will I study concretely:  
  
Anticipation of Existential risk - the historical perspective:  
  
Study into historic instances which increased risk factors associated with epistemic risk. American history, political history, art history, anthro history, etc. (this will be based on advice of professors.) (some of these may be choice categories (ie. "a history course" can fulfill a requirement possibly or "two history courses + /this specific course/")  
  
Map of the territory:  
  
Fields that will give me a possible direct link into  
  
a) Rationality and its advancement  
  
Psychology, philosophy, anthropology, (possibly econ..) independent rationality study focusing on 2-3 topics in depth. (e.g. 4 books over 1 semester each focusing on an element of rationality (e.g Looking, introspection, meditation, crux mapping double crux, fermi estimation, niche areas of neuro/psych.)  
  
b) The mitigation of epistemic risk  
  
political science (focus on international relations policy), Again anthropology, environmental science.
