# Thoughts on learning. 

*tl;dr: I should’ve took a gap year brown high school and college.*
  
**What we know for sure** [epistemic status: high certainty]:  
  
Your first week academic pursuit = artistic (or whatever)  
  
you have things like art that are so deeply fascinating that you spend 5 hours doing something without doing or thinking about or getting distracted much else.  
  
These things feel like you’ve always had passion for/ ie spending 5 hours focused doing it  
  
**Premise, what I am suggesting is true:** [epistemic status: medium certainty]
  
You actually in fact do have a period where you art not doing it 5hrs a day in every thing u try to learn. Somethings are so that you don’t ever get past the periods length and it can be long or hard so you stop. But the things that you felt you could always do 5 hrs focused do indeed have a period of nonability to focus / execute, they are just = 0. So you begin to try something and you are so instantly good you see an intense amount of initial progress in a relatively low time in relation to the learning curve of the object/skill/etc. this makes it so you are instantly apon execution for the first time, aware of a progression or compelling approach to what you saw as amazing in the thing/object/skill (the thing you are learning). This instantly creates a habit of high-time spent; quick & high-advancement; very positive and generous learning to achievement to speed ratio.  
  
**What does this tell us?**  
  
How to view ourselves in light of this notion:  
  
Young talented and curious  
More curious = less successful but possibly interesting  
More talented =more successful possibly less interesting  
Young = inexperience = time to learn  
  
**What this tell us we should do:**  
  
This theory implies that we are going to be prone to finding tough tough skills that we start at and burnout at despite really wanting and viewing the end goal as incredible. This is because the time between first attempt and slight improvement are insanely long (sometimes or often years). We have experienced nothing like this being so young (talent is easy to see because we become amazing at those things at an early age or at least good at them. impossible to tell what we were untalented in because achievement range is sometimes tied to body/mental development (ie lifting running rock climbing philosophy, serious writing etc) so we have changed so much making it hard to have had any moments of true adversity as a child. Childhood moves like lightening this is a cause and is caused by childhood. (Insert subject object relation German ideal.)  
  
**So what does this mean?**  
  
Ok well can you use the original childhood method? No increasingly no. If you have been curious as a child you probably tried many many things and found a lot of the things ur inherently untalented at or u find inherently dis interesting...  
  
[it is likely these things have interesting intersections that tie them together therefore making it so one thing you don’t find interesting represents a category of things you don’t or do find interesting allowing you to speed up distinction process with age]  
  
...And so as you age to a point you will only encounter stuff you are not talented at of don’t find interesting. This makes early method, ie childhood, ineffective.  
  
**What should a new method be?**  
  
Capitalize of initial surges of interest or inspiration. Go hard and remember the feeling.  
  
This is my current theory of the best and most rational course of action. You must literally act or perform the feeling of intense focus and interest. You must manufacture -make a facade of- the desired true state (deep interest pure focus etc) and then you must continually reestablish the fantasy until it becomes reality through true unabashed recognition of progress in skill at which point you have achieved genuine deep interest pure focus etc.  
  
**How can I stay committed to this?**  
  
Have triggers that you commit to reminding you to do it. Eg a notification random days of week or hours, a ritual at an exact scheduled time that holds special significance in mental or physical action (create a talisman imbue and object whatever),  
  
Finally, create community: you need a non ironic non meta-interested group of people who are following the same achievement goal plan as you who are committed to mutual benefit through reciprocal reliance as well inter-relational social benefits (better friends).  
  
**Will this work completely?**  
  
No of course it won’t. But this is an accurate map of the territory. Not sure how to test but for a significant intersection of most economically privileged people I believe with strong confidence is true. But yeah you might do everything right and fail. Note that that is because your mind is not a computer (completely that is). Have that be a signal that noise entered the system you were using - not that the system is wrong.  
  
Fight on.
